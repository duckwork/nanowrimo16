Fran glared past her mother's glare
to the ridge ringing their camp bathed
in autumn
            It was beautiful she thought
the trees climbing the mountains
like a slow fire
                 the leaves like embers

before they were like those leaves
when her family was a tree in a cul-de-sac
at the end of a paved road
                            when life

Fran said again, louder: Smoke.  And she began to smile,
because smoke meant fire, and because fire meant someone
else, someone who wasn't grim or moody or annoying or
unfair, someone who didn't know all her jokes already or
laughed because they knew they were supposed to, someone who
could widen the boundaries of who, and therefore what, she
knew.  So she pointed, and smiled, and said Smoke.  And
Jared said,
